            Above we see the decimal expansion of the fraction 1 / 7.
            The positions in this expansion start at the first digit to the
            right of the decimal point at 1 (one). They increase to the right
            and stop before the first repeated digit. So the fraction 1 / 7 has
            6 (six) total positions numbered from 1 to 6, left to right. <br><br>

            Below we see the list of numerators and associated data such as their
            starting position in the decimal expansion of the fraction. Note that
            the starting position involves connecting the front of the repeating
            digits to the back to make a circle. So, taking
            [1, 2, 3, ..., 6] / 7 as an example: <br><br>
